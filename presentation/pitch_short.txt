Filters are very important components in a multitude of applications that are essential to our day-to-day lives. They are vital in communication receivers and transmitters in order select channel reception, block interference from various sources as well as avoid transmission in unwanted frequencies that can have technical as well as legal implications. 
There is a variety of ways to build electronic filters, the most simple of which are lumped component RLC resonating circuits. However, all the applications I just mentioned are using frequencies in the MHz and GHz domain. That gives rise to a very important problem. 
In high frequencies, building lumped element filters is highly impractical.
In order to solve this problem we designed, built by hand and debugged a series of band stop and band pass filters made by microstrips. Microstrips allow us to design and build some highly accurate filters with straightforward tools and manufacturing processes. 
I am Dimitris from team bandwavy, and with Andres and Justin, we worked on building filters for RF applications.
Justin will explain, the build process and filters’ results and Andres will show how our filters can be used to block all signals but Wi-Fi or just block Wi-Fi.
