Filters are very important components in a multitude of applications that are essential to our day-to-day lives. They are vital in communication receivers and transmitters in order select channel reception, block interference from various sources as well as avoid transmission in unwanted frequencies that can have technical as well as legal implications. 
There is a variety of ways to build electronic filters, the most simple of which are lumped component RLC resonating circuits. However, all the applications I just mentioned are using frequencies in the RF domain, in MHz and GHz. That gives rise to a very important problem. 
If we wanted to build lumped element circuit filters for our 2.4 GHz radar frequency, we would need an LC product of 10e-20. Given that our traces would have a capacitance no smaller than 1pF, we would need inductors as small as 10nH. However, a simple wire to join the components would have an inductance 20 times as high. It is thus evident that in high frequencies building lumped element filters is highly impractical.
In order to solve this problem we designed, developed and debugged a series of band stop and band pass filters made by microstrips. Microstrips allow us to design and build some highly accurate filters with straightforward tools and manufacturing processes. 
I am Dimitris from team bandwavy, and with Andres and Justin, we worked on building filters for RF applications.
Justin will explain, the build process and filters’ results and Andres will show how our filters can be used by blocking all signals but Wi-Fi or only block Wi-Fi.
