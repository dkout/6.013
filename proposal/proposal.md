# Overview

We want to learn to design, build and analyze microstrip filters. After all,
what could be cooler than a useful circuit with no lumped components. We hope
that we will be able to build a system for detecting which WiFi channel (out of
two) is in use with a single antenna, without any lumped-circuit filters or
signal processing.

# Example Filter Design

# Testing Filters Using Our "Radar"

# Application to WiFi Channel Detection
