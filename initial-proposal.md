# metal detector


Our group will use RADAR to analyze reflected power and transmitted power from various metals in an attempt to classify their intrinsic properties such as permittivity and permeability. Once we quantify such metals we will use the data to sweep a room to find a particular metal we are interested in and define its distance. We will also characterize the penetration depth of each metal.
